<!-- The first four sections: "Problem to solve", "Intended users", "User experience goal", and "Proposal", are strongly recommended, while the rest of the sections can be filled out during the design stage of a new Saffron version. However, keep in mind that providing complete and relevant information early helps us validating the problem and start working on a solution. -->

### Problem to solve

<!-- What problem do we solve? Try to define the who/what/why of the opportunity as a user story. For example, "As a (who), I want (what), so I can (why/value)." -->

### Intended users

<!-- Who will use this feature? If known, include any of the following: types of users (e.g. Developer, Non-technical), personas (e.g. a person trying to achieve X). It's okay to write "Unknown" and fill this field in later.

-->

### User experience goal

<!-- What is the single user experience workflow this problem addresses? 
For example, "The user should be able to use the UI/command line/API with Saffron <step> to <perform a specific task>"
--> 


### Proposal

<!-- How are we going to solve the problem? Try to include the user journey! -->

### Further details

<!-- Include use cases, benefits, goals, or any other details that will help us understand the problem better. -->


### Support Documentation

<!--
Add any supporting documentation on the best approaches to implement this feature.
-->

### Availability & Testing

<!-- This section needs to be filled during the design phase of a new Saffron version.

What risks does this change pose to current features in Saffron? (don't say 'none')
How might it affect the quality of the final product?
What additional test coverage or changes to tests will be needed?
Will it require cross-browser testing?

-->

### What does success look like, and how can we measure that?

<!-- 
Define both the success metrics and acceptance criteria. Note that success metrics indicate the desired business outcomes, while acceptance criteria indicate when the solution is working correctly. If there is no way to measure success, link to an issue that will implement a way to measure this. -->


### Is this a cross-module feature?

<!-- Communicate if this change will affect multiple Saffron modules. If so, which modules? -->
